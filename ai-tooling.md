# AI tooling

Codex assisted with the Python virtual environment, Docker development setup,
dataset inspection and documentation, and implementation of the seven-model
comparison, pipeline serialization, evaluation CLI, and automated tests.
It used the project PDF and shared `AGENTS.md` requirements, checked local CSV
statistics, and consulted official scikit-learn and CatBoost documentation.

Docker validation caught a disk-space constraint during the CatBoost rebuild;
project-specific build records were inspected and the replacement image was
verified. Automated tests exercised model fitting and serialization rather
than assuming package installation guaranteed a working pipeline.

Training and evaluation numbers are produced by the Python scripts. Development
assistance is distinct from the future deployed conversational agent; no deployed
LLM or agent integration has been implemented yet. The project author must
review, understand, and explain the resulting code and experiment design.
